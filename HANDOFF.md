# Handoff

Updated: 2026-10-01 (GTA V × Elden Ring priority and setup audit).

## Current priority and setup audit

- Owner now prioritizes GTA V × Elden Ring: a boss encounter with native GTA guns and helicopter weapons. See docs/CROSSOVER-BACKLOG.md for the sequence and additional ten-minute demo ideas.
- Owner clarified that GTA V and Elden Ring are purchased but NOT downloaded; native macOS Steam blocked the Windows-only downloads. On this Studio, the registered native Steam library currently lists only MW2 single-player and multiplayer manifests (both StateFlags 4), sharing the MW2 directory. This does not prove gameplay or complete Windows asset compatibility.
- GTA V and Elden Ring require downloading through Windows Steam in CrossOver. Their absence in the registered native library is now explained.
- Owner approved Rosetta installation. Before the pending click could execute, the UI had already advanced; pkgutil subsequently verified the Rosetta installation receipt. CrossOver completed Windows Steam installation in its new Steam bottle and reports Ready. Steam was launched and its bootstrap log confirms its initial client update and verification completed. The latest login log reports WaitingForNetwork after a login attempt; successful account authentication and a usable library are not yet verified. The computer-use app inventory did not expose a controllable Windows Steam login window. Steam/Steam Guard and later Rockstar authentication may require owner interaction. No game has launched.
- No game launched, no mod loader installed, no boss converted, and no GTA gameplay verified.
- Documentation branch: codex/gta-elden-ring-plan, based on the preserved codex/mac-prototype branch.

## Previous Terminal goal and owner decisions

- Public open source project with a ten-minute Terminal crossover demo for a video.
- Mac is the first build target. The owner authorized autonomous implementation and will provide game data later.
- Earlier implementation lacked retail data. The new owner report and current audit above supersede that setup status.
- Terminal means the MW2 airport map.
- Signature proposal: builder gun, skating, confirmed-trick charge, dragon killstreak, objective/extraction/restart loop.
- Additional research: universal-modder, the Minecraft/Elden Ring clip, libsm64 and CrossOver. Preserve the Terminal objective while expanding through reusable adapters.

## Repository and ownership

- Public remote: https://github.com/oh-ashen-one/modern-warfare-2-ai
- Working branch: codex/mac-prototype, based on codex/terminal-foundation.
- The original foundation branch remains the default; no main/default-branch merge is authorized or performed.
- No other session's game process, bottle or checkout was changed.

## Completed and verified

- Pinned mashup source imported into runtime/ with upstream LICENSE/NOTICE. See docs/UPSTREAM-IMPORT.md.
- Rust 1.98.1 installed and pinned. Native arm64 optimized engine executable built successfully on the M3 Ultra Studio.
- SwiftUI setup app, Rust setup CLI, safe process launch path, file validation and game-folder configuration implemented.
- Minecraft automatic data downloads disabled in the Mac launcher. No commercial game data downloaded.
- Mac board/rig preparation command added. The Skate conversion helper refuses missing data and existing output paths.
- Independent mission/block rule crate implemented; eight meaningful tests pass. Strict Clippy and formatting pass for original Rust crates.
- Native setup window inspected visually and through accessibility; refresh and folder-picker cancellation verified. Launch stays disabled with missing MW2 data.
- Apple Silicon setup preview packaged with local ad-hoc signing and license notices for 499 Rust packages.
- Local deliverable folder: ~/Applications/Modern-Warfare-2-AI-Preview/
- Packaging is reproducible with scripts/build-mac.sh; use MW2AI_OUTPUT_DIR outside iCloud/Documents to avoid File Provider signing metadata.

## Honest boundary

- The mission/block rules are NOT yet wired into the runtime.
- No Terminal rendering, shooting, bots, skating or full gameplay session has been tested because retail data is missing.
- No Skyrim model/animation conversion or dragon encounter has been implemented.
- No claim of 60 fps, full controller compatibility or finished ten-minute gameplay is made.
- The delivered app is a setup preview plus compiled base runtime, not the finished game.

## CrossOver and more-game research

- CrossOver 26.2 is installed on the Studio.
- Steam shortcuts exist, but their named bottle was not found in the default bottle locations by the read-only CLI check. No bottle was created, modified or started.
- universal-modder's published worked bridge is Minecraft/GTA V on Windows. The linked Elden Ring clip is by a different creator; captions were unavailable, and only four frames were sampled.
- Neither universal-modder nor libsm64 has been imported or installed. They are references in docs/MORE-GAMES.md.

## Previous Terminal next steps (backlog)

1. Provide owned MW2 (2009 PC) multiplayer data to the native setup app; verify the unchanged Terminal baseline first.
2. Supply/convert Skate 3 data and verify real controls, animation, collision, death and restart.
3. Connect the prepared mission/block rules to actual game events and collision/rendering; add the builder weapon.
4. Supply Skyrim data, establish the conversion pipeline, and implement the bounded dragon strike.
5. Complete the ten-minute mission and obtain owner gameplay feedback before calling it finished.
6. For Windows-host experiments on the Mac, locate the actual CrossOver bottle storage and create a separate task-owned bottle before testing loader/depth/compositor compatibility.

## Commands

- cargo test --workspace --locked
- cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
- cargo fmt --all --check
- MW2AI_OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/Applications/Modern-Warfare-2-AI-Preview" bash scripts/build-mac.sh
- cargo run -p mw2ai-launcher -- doctor --json
- cargo run -p mw2ai-launcher -- demo-check

Read docs/BUILD-STATUS.md and docs/MAC-SETUP.md for exact limitations. Do not treat the scripted rule check as gameplay evidence.
