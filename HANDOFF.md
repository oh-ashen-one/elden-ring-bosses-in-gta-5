# Handoff

Updated: 2026-10-01 (GTA V × Elden Ring priority and setup audit).

## Current priority and setup audit

- Active goal: GTA V × Elden Ring, with a boss damaged by native GTA firearms, explosives, vehicle impacts and helicopter weapons. See docs/CROSSOVER-BACKLOG.md.
- Windows Steam is installed and authenticated sufficiently to download games in the CrossOver Steam bottle. Rosetta is installed. No GTA or Elden Ring gameplay has been verified.
- Current queue includes GTA V Legacy, Elden Ring, Dark Souls Remastered and Escape the Backrooms. Windows MW2 and Phasmophobia manifests now report installed. Recheck live manifests before use.
- Storage: 512 GB writable exFAT SD card named memory, mounted at /Volumes/memory, UUID AB55E1EC-D2BD-38BD-961F-56347E0F5C9D; CrossOver maps it as D:. Initial inventory showed roughly 512 GB free. Reserved logical game files total roughly 274 GB; live totals may grow.
- Owner explicitly chose to let downloads finish BEFORE moving games to the SD card. Do not interrupt, pause, stop or relocate active downloads. An earlier shutdown request did not stop the client; no files have been moved or deleted.
- Active thread heartbeat move-steam-games-after-downloads-finish checks every 15 minutes. It must verify the whole queue is complete before a safe migration, verify destination contents before source removal, and disable itself after success. It does not launch games.
- CrossOver and Steam client/account data stay internal. Only game data moves; no reformat is authorized or needed.
- No mod loader installed, no boss converted, no GTA gameplay verified. Current independent work can cover the encounter specification, original boss rules and tests, and investigation of the asset conversion route. GTA adapter and visible gameplay require the installed game.
- Working branch: codex/gta-elden-ring-plan, based on the preserved codex/mac-prototype branch.

## Midir coordination

- On 2026-10-01 Hari explicitly authorized this session to own the main GTA V × Elden Ring game and Midir to own one or two separate showcase builds.
- Sent the updated scope, candidate side-demo brief, repository/branch pointer, and strict checkout/bottle/download/process ownership boundaries using send_message_to_thread to the dot conversation 01a0f57b-1eee-7674-9735-1ab9034fe0f7 on host durable. The API confirmed delivery; do not claim acceptance or a running side build until observed.
- That dot previously spawned Review game combines project (01a0f57f-2350-7535-a601-3d6186da00c2), which had read an older mac-prototype snapshot. The new brief corrects its outdated target and setup status.
- We did not create an additional fork/session. Recommend separate repositories for different game hosts, or isolated worktrees/branches when sharing code. Do not mix active game/mod profiles.

## Previous Terminal goal and owner decisions

- Public open source project with a ten-minute Terminal crossover demo for a video.
- Mac is the first build target. The owner authorized autonomous implementation and will provide game data later.
- Earlier implementation lacked retail data. The new owner report and current audit above supersede that setup status.
- Terminal means the MW2 airport map.
- Signature proposal: builder gun, skating, confirmed-trick charge, dragon killstreak, objective/extraction/restart loop.
- Additional research: universal-modder, the Minecraft/Elden Ring clip, libsm64 and CrossOver. Preserve the Terminal objective while expanding through reusable adapters.

## Repository and ownership

- Public remote: https://github.com/oh-ashen-one/modern-warfare-2-ai
- Earlier implementation branch: codex/mac-prototype, based on codex/terminal-foundation. Current branch is listed above.
- The original foundation branch remains the default; no main/default-branch merge is authorized or performed.
- No other session's game process, bottle or checkout was changed.

## Completed and verified

- Pinned mashup source imported into runtime/ with upstream LICENSE/NOTICE. See docs/UPSTREAM-IMPORT.md.
- Rust 1.98.1 installed and pinned. Native arm64 optimized engine executable built successfully on the M3 Ultra Studio.
- SwiftUI setup app, Rust setup CLI, safe process launch path, file validation and game-folder configuration implemented.
- Minecraft automatic data downloads disabled in the Mac launcher. No commercial game data downloaded.
- Mac board/rig preparation command added. The Skate conversion helper refuses missing data and existing output paths.
- Independent mission/block rule crate implemented; eight meaningful tests pass. Strict Clippy and formatting pass for original Rust crates.
- Native setup window inspected visually and through accessibility; refresh and folder-picker cancellation verified. Launch stays disabled with missing MW2 data.
- Apple Silicon setup preview packaged with local ad-hoc signing and license notices for 499 Rust packages.
- Local deliverable folder: ~/Applications/Modern-Warfare-2-AI-Preview/
- Packaging is reproducible with scripts/build-mac.sh; use MW2AI_OUTPUT_DIR outside iCloud/Documents to avoid File Provider signing metadata.

## Honest boundary

- The mission/block rules are NOT yet wired into the runtime.
- No Terminal rendering, shooting, bots, skating or full gameplay session has been tested because retail data is missing.
- No Skyrim model/animation conversion or dragon encounter has been implemented.
- No claim of 60 fps, full controller compatibility or finished ten-minute gameplay is made.
- The delivered app is a setup preview plus compiled base runtime, not the finished game.

## CrossOver and more-game research

- CrossOver 26.2 is installed on the Studio.
- The earlier missing-bottle finding is superseded: the Steam bottle now exists and Windows Steam is downloading games.
- universal-modder's published worked bridge is Minecraft/GTA V on Windows. The linked Elden Ring clip is by a different creator; captions were unavailable, and only four frames were sampled.
- Neither universal-modder nor libsm64 has been imported or installed. They are references in docs/MORE-GAMES.md.

## Previous Terminal next steps (backlog)

1. Provide owned MW2 (2009 PC) multiplayer data to the native setup app; verify the unchanged Terminal baseline first.
2. Supply/convert Skate 3 data and verify real controls, animation, collision, death and restart.
3. Connect the prepared mission/block rules to actual game events and collision/rendering; add the builder weapon.
4. Supply Skyrim data, establish the conversion pipeline, and implement the bounded dragon strike.
5. Complete the ten-minute mission and obtain owner gameplay feedback before calling it finished.
6. For Windows-host experiments on the Mac, locate the actual CrossOver bottle storage and create a separate task-owned bottle before testing loader/depth/compositor compatibility.

## Commands

- cargo test --workspace --locked
- cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
- cargo fmt --all --check
- MW2AI_OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/Applications/Modern-Warfare-2-AI-Preview" bash scripts/build-mac.sh
- cargo run -p mw2ai-launcher -- doctor --json
- cargo run -p mw2ai-launcher -- demo-check

Read docs/BUILD-STATUS.md and docs/MAC-SETUP.md for exact limitations. Do not treat the scripted rule check as gameplay evidence.
